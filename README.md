## General Information

### Project Background

> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.Â 

### The business is curious about:

The company wants to know:

    Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

    How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

### Project Statement

> This research aims to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.



## Conclusions

> 	The below mentioned variables are significant in predicting the price
